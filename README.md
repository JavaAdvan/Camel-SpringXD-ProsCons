Apache Camel vs Spring XD comparision.

**Introduction:**

In this article, we are going to analyze if Spring XD is a better replacement for Apache Camel.

**Analysis:**

Apache Camel:

Camel is an Open Source integration framework that empowers you to quickly and easily integrate various systems consuming or producing data.

Current Version: RELEASE 3.14.2

Spring XD:

Spring XD is a unified, distributed, and extensible system for data ingestion, real time analytics, batch processing, and data export. The project’s goal is to simplify the development of big data applications.

Current Version: Spring XD’s 1.3 GA(Support Ended on July 2017)

Apache Camel vs Spring XD:

The Apache Camel is great for out of the box connectors and community support. The Apache Camel is very widely adopted in the industry as an integration tool.

Spring XD (or Spring Integration) doesn't seem to be widely adopted in the industry as a typical integration framework. But one major advantage Spring XD has over Apache Camel is handling very large data sets. So for big data processing and stream handling this seems to be an ideal.

The unique selling point for Spring XD is its ability to handle big data. This capability will give it advantages with handling huge volume and velocity of data over Apache Camel.

So, in the comparision between Apache Camel and Spring XD, the Apache Camel is seen as the most preferred integration tool with wide industry adoption. But for use cases with large volume of data processing and analytics support - Spring XD is the clear winner. 

So the decision should be taken considering relative merits -
ease of use - Apache Camel.
Large volume of data - Spring XD.

Spring XD also offers closed loop analytics. 

If Spring XD, is being considered it would be beneficial to go with Spring Cloud Data Flow.

The Spring Cloud Data Flow - Spring Cloud Data Flow is the cloud native redesign of Spring XD - a project that aimed to simplify Big Data application development. This redesign allows running stream and batch applications as data microservices and they can independently evolve in isolation.

Current Version: 2.9.2

Spring XD vs Spring Cloud Data Flow

Some limitations identified in Spring XD are scaling capabilities, canary deployments, resource allocation such as different modules being given different memory allocation, distributed tracing, and so on. Another limitation is related to the use of a classic parent-child classloader hierarchy as opposed to a flat classloader which is possible in an isolated microservice application architecture.

To solve the class loader problem the existing integration and batch modules have been refactored to Spring Boot apps with isolated flat classloaders. In effect the redesign allows stream and batch applications to run as data microservices that can be independently evolved.

**Conclusion:** 
if ease of use, out of the box connectors to various data sources and better community support were major considerations it is better to go for Apache Camel.
In case of large volume of data or stream processing Spring XD / Spring Cloud Data Flow would be a better choice.

So the use cases / problem areas we need to address in a project will define the technology of choice.
